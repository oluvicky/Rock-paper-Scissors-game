ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME 

This is a code written to play the game called Rock-paper-scissors.

Here it is for the establishment of the fact that this game can be played in anywhere during an hangout, picnic or even at the emergence of the necessary terms and conditions that is attached.


The major thing is to be able to make the game to be at least two users. So below is the plan to write the code for two players of the game.

 First is to declare the two players "player 1 and player 2" which can be either human player  and computer or two human player. I will also declare the three different outcomes that are attainable. 

 I will use IF-THEN-ELSE construct to implement the code.

 Since I know that "Rock beats scissors and Scissors beats paper and paper beats Rock. Those are three possible outcomes. 

Since it is best played as two players, I am adopting  five rounds as used in the example in the odin project. 

When Rock and Rock is played it will return no winner, same as Scissors and scissors and paper and paper.

However, when rock and scissors is played, "rock" will return as the winner.

When Scissors and paper is played, scissors will emerge as winner.


And when rock and paper is played. Paper will emerge as the winner, that is the plan behind the game. 

Depending on luck and mental prowess, one of the players can win all through having 5-0 and like that.

 We can only give the general probability of possible outcome.

This game is one of the interesting games that I played while I was in Secondary School( which is also known as  High School).
